.SH NAME
.B ibus\-fbterm
\- IBus front\-end for FbTerm

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
ibus\-fbterm is an input method for FbTerm based on IBus.

.PP
This is a wrapper to run dbus\-daemon, ibus\-daemon, fbterm and
ibus\-fbterm\-backend.

.SH "KEY BINDING"
The recent ibus\-fbterm no longer uses the protocol of fbterm because
fbterm would bind Control\-space focibly and now the private header files
are not used to communicate between fbterm and ibus\-fbterm\-backend.

.PP
The default keybinding is Super\-space to switch ibus engines.
Most keybdings would not work due to VT100 keybindings.
Super\-space and Control\-space are tested to work fine.

.PP
Super\-space switches the first two IMEs only.  To show 
IBus IME switcher panel can be launched by \fBdouble\fR Super\-space keys
instead of Super\-space\-space because VT100 does not handle key release
events.

.PP
Shift modifier can be generated by Escape key in ibus\-fbterm
because VT100 does not handle Shift modifier.
E.g. The reverse switching keybinding is Escape and Super\-space keys
instead of Shift\-Super\-space.
E.g. Escape and space keys can generate Shift\-space key and
it might be used in ibus\-hangul.
Notice: Escape and space keys enable Hangul and
only Escape key disables Hangul in ibus\-hangul by default.
But I'd recommned to use Control\-space rather than Escape and space
with ibus\-setup\-hangul because Escape key disables \fBvi\fR mode.
